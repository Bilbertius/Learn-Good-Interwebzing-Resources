# The repository for kids who cant interwebz good and want to learn to do otherthings good too

This is a list of resources that may or may not aid those learning various web technologies. Everyone learns differently, so I have tried to include resources that I think would be helpful to others even if I  personally found no use in them. This includeds, but is not limited to tools, editor and/or browser extensions, articles, free courses, cheat sheets, and youtube channels that cover everything from the most basic concepts up to the more advanced topics. Hopefully there is something here that Will prove helpful in your journey. 

Note: I will try to provide notes on each resource regarding what level you would want to be at and what skills you would ideally want inorder to get the most of of said resource.
